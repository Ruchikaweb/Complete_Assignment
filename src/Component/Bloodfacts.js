                <li>Blood makes up about 7% of your body's weight.</li>
                <li>An average adult has about 14 to 18 pints of Blood</li>
                <li>One standard unit or pint of Blood equals about two cups.</li>
                <li>Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to all of the body.</li>
                <li>Blood carries carbon dioxide and other waste products back to the lungs, kidneys and liver for disposal.</li>
                <li>Blood fights against infection and helps heal wounds.</li>
                <li>One unit of donated whole Blood is separated into components before use (red Blood cells, white Blood cells, plasma, platelets, etc.)</li>
                <li>There are four main Blood types: A, B, AB and O.</li>
                <li>Each Blood type is either Rh positive or negative.</li>
                <li>There are about one billion red Blood cells in a few drops of whole Blood.</li>
                <li>Red Blood cells live about 120 days in our bodies.</li>
                <li>Red Blood cells can be stored under normal conditions for up to 42 days.</li>
                <li>Frozen red Blood cells can be stored for ten years, and more.</li>
                <li>Platelets must be used within five days.</li>
                <li>Platelets are small Blood cells that assist in the process of Blood clotting helping those with leukemia and other cancers, controlling bleeding.</li>
                <li>Plasma, the fourth major component of Blood, is a sticky, pale yellow fluid mixture of water, protein and salts. It is 95% water. The other 5% is made up of nutrients, proteins and hormones.</li>
                <li>Blood Plasma constitutes 55% of the volume of human Blood.</li>
                <li>Plasma helps maintain Blood pressure, carries Blood cells, nutrients, enzymes and hormones, and supplies critical proteins for Blood clotting and immunity.</li>
                <li>Type AB plasma has been considered as the universal Blood plasma type, and therefore AB plasma is given to patients with any Blood type</li>
                <li>Frozen Plasma can be stored for up to one year.</li>
                <li>Human Blood; red Blood cells, white Blood cells, plasma and platelets are made naturally by the body in the bone marrow.</li>
